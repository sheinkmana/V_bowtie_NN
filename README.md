## Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage
This repository provides a Python implementation of the Variational Bow tie neural network (VBNN). 

The VBNN is described and derived in a [Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11132) paper.

 ### Repository has the following files:
 
- VBNN_class.py which contains the main code for the network. 
- helpers.py which contains utilities for easy training and testing.
- test.ipynb notebook which shows how to run VBNN on a simulated example.
