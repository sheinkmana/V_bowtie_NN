## Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage
This repository provides a Python implementation of the Variational Bow tie neural network (VBNN). 

The VBNN is described and derived in a [Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11132) paper.

#### The main_code folder contains the full VBNN model's code, as well as utilities for model running and benchmarking. 


 #### The toy_example folder has the following older files:
- VBNN_class.py which contains the simplified code logic for the network. 
- helpers.py which contains utilities for easy training and testing.
- test.ipynb notebook which shows how to run VBNN on a simulated example.
