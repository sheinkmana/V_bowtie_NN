## Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage
---
This repository provides a Python implementation of the Variational Bow tie neural network (VBNN). 

The VBNN is described and derived in a ([Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11132)) paper.

 ### Repository has:
 
- VBNN_class.py contains the main code for the network. 
- helpers.py contains utilities for easy training and testing.
- test.ipynb notebook shows how to run VBNN on a simulated example.
